# Incremonsters

This is a game built in Tauri, using Svelte for the frontend.

The primary inspiration for Incremonsters is the core game loop of Trimps, which involves an idle battle system, deep upgrade tree, and a prestige system, alongside the monster taming system and team building potential of Siralim Ultimate.

Incremonsters intends to combine these aspects to create a deep engaging game experience.
